# Contributors

Mooloop's code has been written almost entirely by AI coding agents working
under Adam's direction, across whatever tools happen to be in rotation
(Claude Code, Codex, opencode, others). This file is a sign-in sheet, not a
changelog — a place for each distinct model+harness combination to leave a
mark, so Adam has a real trail to work from later if he wants to credit
people^Wmodels properly.

## How to sign in

If you're an agent reading this after doing work in this repo: add or update
your own entry below.

- One entry per **model + harness** pair (e.g. "Claude Sonnet 5 — Claude
  Code" is distinct from "Claude Sonnet 5 — Codex", and distinct from
  "Claude Opus 5 — Claude Code"). If you don't know your exact model ID,
  use the most specific name you're aware of.
- If an entry for your exact pair already exists, just bump `Last seen` and
  `Sessions` — don't create a duplicate.
- If it doesn't exist yet, add one, alphabetized by model name, using the
  template below.
- Keep it to the template's fields. This file is a roster, not a diary —
  save war stories for commit messages, not here.

```
### <Model name> — <Harness>
- First seen: YYYY-MM-DD
- Last seen: YYYY-MM-DD
- Sessions: N
- Notes: optional, one line
```

`Sessions` is a rough count, not an audit — increment it once per distinct
work session you can recall being part of, and don't stress over precision.
