# Capacity Policy

Mooloop must not impose small product caps on dynamic musical items. A user
should not encounter a limit such as “16 channels” or “8 effects” because it
made an implementation convenient.

The audio callback cannot allocate, block, or perform unbounded work. That is
an engine constraint, not permission to turn every collection into a tiny
fixed bank. Dynamic state is prepared off the audio thread; callback-facing
storage is then preallocated for the complete supported address space.

## Reserving is not the same as bounding

A ceiling costs nothing. *Dimensioning by* a ceiling costs a great deal, and
the two are easy to confuse. `MAX_CHANNELS` and `MAX_EFFECTS_PER_CHANNEL` are
both the `u8` index space, and the render graph once reserved their product —
65,536 effect slots, each with a 320-byte pending queue — so an empty project
paid 42.8 MiB before it held anything. Boxing the slot state and materializing
channels from the project took a sixteen-channel project to 1.1 MiB with both
ceilings untouched (`docs/plans/modulator-capacity/00-status.md`).

The lesson is the one this policy already implies, stated the other way round:
a large address space is fine, and preallocating the whole of it in advance is
the thing to avoid. The number was invisible at every individual definition
and only appeared when they were multiplied, which is why that plan left a
test measuring the whole graph rather than a paragraph.

## Current boundaries

- The current channel and effect bridges use complete `u8` address spaces:
  256 of each. These are transitional bridge-format boundaries, not UI policy
  caps. `MIXER_PLAN.md` replaces positional channel/bus addressing with stable
  signal-slot identities and a per-project prepared render plan, removing the
  fixed mixer-bank model rather than normalizing it as permanent.
- Pattern IDs likewise use a complete `u8` address space (256 patterns).
- Event lists, block size, voice pools, sample memory, playlist span, and
  routing have explicit realtime, DSP, or file-format reasons. Any change to
  one must name the reason and show overflow behavior.
- The 16-insert mixer-bus bank is a legacy fixed-graph implementation detail,
  not a product decision. It is the next capacity-sweep candidate; do not use
  it as a precedent for new dynamic collections.
- Modulation capacity — eight modules and sixteen routes a channel — is a
  compile-time constant with a measured, linear price, deliberately rather
  than a layout assumption: the grid's rows follow the constant and a test
  renders the shelf at eight and at sixteen so a re-introduced literal fails.
  Raising it is one edit. It stays a constant because a variable-length rack
  on the realtime path buys a bounds check every tick and an allocation story
  every edit, to save memory the reservation fix already recovered.

## Rule for new work

Before adding a numerical cap to a user-created collection, first use an
off-thread prepared, callback-safe representation. If a finite boundary is
truly required, document it next to the type and in the persisted-format
validation, make the UI communicate it honestly, and add a test at the
boundary. “It was easier to preallocate” is not a sufficient reason.
